To be able to work well, I need some information about you and other Discord users. Because of that, I have my Terms of Service so that you are able to see what I get from you and of course, everything that I can do!

Briefly: **You are responsible of any image/video/audio/media sent to me, Abusing bugs, using self-bots or cheating are prohibited and will result in a permanent ban of the usage of my features (and other services). We collect information such as your ID, username, avatar, servers, messages, media and other data (but we wont distribute such information to third parties). You may be suspended of using Saphire or any other service for any cause, you wont be able to recover data if lost, and you have to agree with everything that is in the Terms of Service.**
